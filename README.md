Learning GitHub
hello fellow programmers. I am Seyuran from South Africa and I am keen on learning how the GitHub community works.
I have 6 years of experience of programming... currently i know c++ , java, python and Delphi. Yet I do wanna learn more in depth with
these programming langauages. My dream is to go into the robotics industry which i will work for, with the help of the community i will 
reach my goals.
